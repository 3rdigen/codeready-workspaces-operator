## Building CRW Operator and Metadata containers

### Operator container

* The CRW operator has some of its code in the upstream link:https://github.com/eclipse/che-operator/[che-operator] repo, including this link:https://github.com/eclipse/che-operator/blob/master/Dockerfile[Dockerfile].

* This code is then synced to the downstream repo via this link:https://codeready-workspaces-jenkins.rhev-ci-vms.eng.rdu2.redhat.com/view/CRW_CI/view/Releng/job/crw-operator_sync-github-to-pkgs.devel-pipeline/[job] (link:https://github.com/redhat-developer/codeready-workspaces-operator/blob/master/operator.Jenkinsfile[operator.Jenkinsfile]).

NOTE: The job can be configured to sync from any upstream che-operator branch, eg., `SOURCE_BRANCH` = `crw-2.0` or `master`.

* Once the sync is done:

** the link:http://pkgs.devel.redhat.com/cgit/containers/codeready-workspaces-operator/?h=crw-2.0-rhel-8[codeready-workspaces-operator] repo is updated;

** a Brew build will be triggered via link:https://codeready-workspaces-jenkins.rhev-ci-vms.eng.rdu2.redhat.com/job/get-sources-rhpkg-container-build/[this job]; 

** and, if successful, the Brew build will be link:https://codeready-workspaces-jenkins.rhev-ci-vms.eng.rdu2.redhat.com/view/CRW_CI/view/Pipelines/job/push-container-to-quay/[pushed to Quay] as `link:https://quay.io/repository/crw/operator-rhel8?tag=latest&tab=tags[quay.io/crw/operator-rhel8]`.

### Metadata container

* Metadata for the CRW operator is contained in this repo. See link:https://github.com/redhat-developer/codeready-workspaces-operator/tree/master/controller-manifests[controller-manifests] and link:https://github.com/redhat-developer/codeready-workspaces-operator/tree/master/deploy[deploy] folders, and this link:https://github.com/redhat-developer/codeready-workspaces-operator/blob/master/operator-metadata.Dockerfile[operator-metadata.Dockerfile].

NOTE: Sync from upstream to `controller-manifests` and `deploy` folders are not yet done automatically. TODO in link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/CRW-579[CRW-579].

* The metadata is then synced to the downstream repo via this link:https://codeready-workspaces-jenkins.rhev-ci-vms.eng.rdu2.redhat.com/view/CRW_CI/view/Releng/job/crw-operator-metadata_sync-github-to-pkgs.devel-pipeline/[job] (link:https://github.com/redhat-developer/codeready-workspaces-operator/blob/master/operator-metadata.Jenkinsfile[operator-metadata.Jenkinsfile]).

NOTE: The job can be configured to sync from any upstream che-operator branch, eg., `SOURCE_BRANCH` = `master`.

* Once the sync is done:

** the link:http://pkgs.devel.redhat.com/cgit/containers/codeready-workspaces-operator-metadata/?h=crw-2.0-rhel-8[codeready-workspaces-operator-metadata] repo is updated;

** a Brew build will be triggered via link:https://codeready-workspaces-jenkins.rhev-ci-vms.eng.rdu2.redhat.com/job/get-sources-rhpkg-container-build/[this job]; 

** and, if successful, the Brew build will be link:https://codeready-workspaces-jenkins.rhev-ci-vms.eng.rdu2.redhat.com/view/CRW_CI/view/Pipelines/job/push-container-to-quay/[pushed to Quay] as `link:https://quay.io/repository/crw/operator-metadata?tag=latest&tab=tags[quay.io/crw/operator-metadata]`.
