Links marked with this icon :door: are _internal to Red Hat_. This includes Jenkins servers, job configs in gitlab, and container sources in dist-git. 

Because these services are internal, in the interest of making all things open, we've copied as much as possible into this repo. Details below.

## Building CRW Operator and Metadata containers

### Operator container

* The CRW operator has most of code in the upstream link:https://github.com/eclipse-che/che-operator/[che-operator] repo.

* Code is then synced to https://github.com/redhat-developer/codeready-workspaces-images/tree/crw-2-rhel-8/codeready-workspaces-operator via a job:

  - https://main-jenkins-csb-crwqe.apps.ocp4.prod.psi.redhat.com/job/CRW_CI/ (jobs) :door:
  - https://gitlab.cee.redhat.com/codeready-workspaces/crw-jenkins/-/tree/master/jobs/CRW_CI (sources) :door:
  - https://github.com/redhat-developer/codeready-workspaces-images#jenkins-jobs (copied sources)

Once the sync is done:

* Downstream link:http://pkgs.devel.redhat.com/cgit/containers/codeready-workspaces-operator/?h=crw-2-rhel-8[codeready-workspaces-operator] repo is updated;

* a Brew build will be triggered via **get-sources-rhpkg-container-build** job;

* and, if successful, the Brew build will be copied to Quay] as `https://quay.io/crw/crw-2-rhel8-operator`.

### Metadata container

* The CRW operator metadata has most of code in the upstream link:https://github.com/eclipse-che/che-operator/[che-operator] repo.

* Code is then synced to https://github.com/redhat-developer/codeready-workspaces-images/tree/crw-2-rhel-8/codeready-workspaces-operator-metadata via a job:

  - https://main-jenkins-csb-crwqe.apps.ocp4.prod.psi.redhat.com/job/CRW_CI/ (jobs) :door:
  - https://gitlab.cee.redhat.com/codeready-workspaces/crw-jenkins/-/tree/master/jobs/CRW_CI (sources) :door:
  - https://github.com/redhat-developer/codeready-workspaces-images#jenkins-jobs (copied sources)

* Once the sync is done:

** Downstream link:http://pkgs.devel.redhat.com/cgit/containers/codeready-workspaces-operator-metadata/?h=crw-2-rhel-8[codeready-workspaces-operator-metadata] repo is updated;

** a Brew build will be triggered via **get-sources-rhpkg-container-build** job;

** and, if successful, the Brew build will be copied to Quay] as `https://quay.io/crw/crw-2-rhel8-operator-metadata`.

### Bundle container

* @Since 2.11 - a new experimental replacement for the metadata container is being developed, to allow early access to new features. See https://issues.redhat.com/browse/CRW-2095 

* The CRW operator bundle has most of code in the upstream link:https://github.com/eclipse-che/che-operator/[che-operator] repo.

* Code is then synced to https://github.com/redhat-developer/codeready-workspaces-images/tree/crw-2-rhel-8/codeready-workspaces-operator-bundle via a job:

  - https://main-jenkins-csb-crwqe.apps.ocp4.prod.psi.redhat.com/job/CRW_CI/ (jobs) :door:
  - https://gitlab.cee.redhat.com/codeready-workspaces/crw-jenkins/-/tree/master/jobs/CRW_CI (sources) :door:
  - https://github.com/redhat-developer/codeready-workspaces-images#jenkins-jobs (copied sources)

* Once the sync is done:

** Downstream link:http://pkgs.devel.redhat.com/cgit/containers/codeready-workspaces-operator-bundle/?h=crw-2-rhel-8[codeready-workspaces-operator-bundle] repo is updated;

** a Brew build will be triggered via **get-sources-rhpkg-container-build** job;

** and, if successful, the Brew build will be copied to Quay] as `https://quay.io/crw/crw-2-rhel8-operator-bundle`.

### crwctl CLI binary

* Once the operator and metadata is rebuilt, a new build of link:https://github.com/redhat-developer/codeready-workspaces-chectl[crwctl] is triggered.

* This is triggered because the CRW operator-metadata's link:https://github.com/redhat-developer/codeready-workspaces-operator/tree/master/bundle[bundle folder] is used in crwctl to do deployment when there is no OLM present on the target cluster (OCP 3.11 and 4.1).

See crwctl job located here:
